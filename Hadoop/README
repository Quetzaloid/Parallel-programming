DESCRIPTION:

WordCount: MAP< Each map gets one line of data and emit word as key, file name as value.
           Reduce< Create Hashset to avoid duplication and do reducing

MatVecMul: Put the vector as distributed cache
           MAP< Store the vector from distributed cache to an Arraylist; each map gets one line of data and row index word as key, product as value.
           Reduce< do reducing

Jacobi   : Put the matrix as distributed cache; mapper in charge of calculation and reducer do nothing
           Every turn, check if convergence demand is meeting; if not, delete the previous one and rename the current one as "previous"
